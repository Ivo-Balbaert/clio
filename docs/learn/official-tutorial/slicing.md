# Slicing

Array slicing and indexing in Clio works the same way as in JavaScript.

```text
export fn main argv:
  arr[index] -> console.log
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Older versions of Clio supported multi-dimensional and matrix slicing in the core language, the same is planned for the future versions of Clio
{% endhint %}
